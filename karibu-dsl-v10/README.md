# Vaadin 10 DSL

## Using in your projects

You'll probably want to use [Vaadin On Kotlin](http://www.vaadinonkotlin.eu) which makes use of this library and adds
support for database, REST and other niceties, and has good documentation. However, if you just want to try out the Vaadin
DSL bindings without any database and other stuff, please read on.

You can include Karibu-DSL library into your WAR project very easily,
simply by including appropriate Gradle dependency:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()  // or mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile("com.github.mvysny.karibudsl:karibu-dsl-v10:x.y.z")
}
```

> Note: obtain the newest version from the latest tag name above

Maven: since Karibu-DSL is in Maven-Central, it's very simple, just add it as a dependency:

```xml
<project>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.github.vok.karibudsl</groupId>
			<artifactId>karibu-dsl-v10</artifactId>
			<version>x.y.z</version>
		</dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

However, to quickly test out Karibu DSL you can simply start with one
of the example applications below.

### UI Base Application

A very simple Gradle-based application archetype is located here: https://github.com/mvysny/karibu10-helloworld-application
The project only shows a very simple Button, so it is an ideal quick start application for experimenting
and further development. And you can always consult the [example-v10](../example-v10) project for interesting
components or new ways how to use them.
 
To generate the archetype and run the app:
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvysny/karibu10-helloworld-application
cd karibu10-helloworld-application
./gradlew appRun
```

The app will run on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Please see the [archetype github page](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu10-helloworld-application) for further
details on development.

### "Beverage Buddy" Example Application

The [example-v10](../example-v10) bundles a Beverage Buddy app backed by a dummy data (no database).
Quickly run the bundled example application from the command-line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-dsl
cd karibu-dsl
./gradlew example-v10:appRun
```

The example app will be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

In case of questions you can always [browse the sample project sources here](example-v10).

### How to write DSLs

The following example shows a really simple form with two fields and one "Save" button (todo screenshot).

```kotlin
verticalLayout {
  w = wrapContent
  formLayout {
    isSpacing = true
    textField("Name:") {
      focus()
    }
    textField("Age:")
  }
  horizontalLayout {
    alignment = Alignment.MIDDLE_RIGHT
    button("Save") {
      onLeftClick { okPressed() }
      setPrimary()
    }
  }
}
```

### VerticalLayout / HorizontalLayout

Vaadin 8 layouting extensively depended on the usage of `VerticalLayout` and `HorizontalLayout`. However, the layouting
in Vaadin 10 has been changed radically and it now employs the so-called *flex layout*. Vaadin 10 however
provides `VerticalLayout` and `HorizontalLayout` classes which loosely resembles their Vaadin 8 counterparts.
However, they use flex layout under the hood and hence there are very important differences.

Generally you use the new `HorizontalLayout` as follows:

```
horizontalLayout {
  content { align(right, middle) }
}
```

Important notes:

* `HorizontalLayout` only supports one row of components; if you have multiple rows you need to use `FlexLayout`.
* Never use `setSizeFull()` nor set the `setWidth("100%")` as you used to do with Vaadin 8. With Vaadin 10 it will
not work as you expect. With Vaadin 8 the child would fill the slot allocated by HorizontalLayout. However with Vaadin 10 and flex layout
there are no slots; setting the width to `100%` would make the component match the width of parent - it would set it to be as wide as
the HorizontalLayout is.

Instead of setting the width of the child to `100%`, set the width to some ideal width, say, `100px` (or `null` to wrap its contents).
The child will initially be exactly
as wide as you tell it to be; if you use `flexGrow` the component will enlarge itself automatically.

To alter the layout further, call the following properties on children:
* Most important: `flexGrow` (and its brother `isExpand`) expands that particular child to take up all of the remaining space. The child
is automatically enlarged.
* `verticalAlignSelf` to align child vertically; it is not possible to align particular child horizontally
* `flexShrink` - when there is not enough room for all children then they are shrank
* `flexBasis`

Please read the [Vaadin 10 server-side layouting for Vaadin 8 and Android developers](http://mavi.logdown.com/posts/6855605) for a tutorial on how to
use `VerticalLayout`/`HorizontalLayout`.

### Writing your own components

Usually one writes custom components by extending the `KComposite` class. Please read the [Creating a Component](https://vaadin.com/docs/v10/flow/creating-components/tutorial-component-composite.html) for more details.

> We promote composition over inheritance, similar to [React's Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html).
You should always extend `Composite` instead of extending e.g. `HorizontalLayout` - extending from `HorizontalLayout` makes
it part of your class and you can't replace it with e.g. `FlowLayout` without breaking backward compatibility.

An example of such a component:

```kotlin
class ButtonBar : KComposite() {
    init {
        ui {
            // create the component UI here; maybe even attach very simple listeners here
            horizontalLayout {
                button("ok") {
                    onLeftClick { okClicked() }
                }
                button("cancel") {
                    onLeftClick { cancelClicked() }
                }
            }
        }

        // perform any further initialization here
    }

    // add listener methods here
    private fun okClicked() {}
    private fun cancelClicked() {}
}
```

To allow for your component to be inserted into other layouts, you will need to introduce your own extension method for your component.
Just write the following code below your component:

```kotlin
@VaadinDsl
fun (@VaadinDsl HasComponents).buttonBar(block: (@VaadinDsl ButtonBar).()->Unit = {}) = init(ButtonBar(), block)
```

This will allow you to use your component as follows:

```kotlin
verticalLayout {
  buttonBar {
    styleName = "black"
    ... // etc
  }
}
```

## Launching the example project in Intellij IDEA:

### Gradle's Gretty appRun

You will need to download and install [Intellij Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).
Then, import the project in question by telling Intellij to open the `build.gradle` file as Project.

After the project is imported and all libraries are downloaded, just click the right-most tool window labeled "Gradle";
in the tree just expand the "Tasks" / "gretty", right-click `appRun` and select the topmost option 'Debug ...' - that
way you'll gain both the debugging possibilities and a very basic code redeployment.

Disadvantages:

* For proper code hot-redeployment you'll need JRebel since Java's default debugger hot-redeployment is pretty weak.
  You can work around this by using Tomcat as said below, however that requires the Intellij Ultimate Edition. Luckily,
  it's cheaper than JRebel :-D
* You can also install the [DCEVM](http://ssw.jku.at/dcevm/) patches. It's very easy on Ubuntu - just install the `openjdk-8-jre-dcevm`
  package and enable it by passing the `-dcevm` VM option.

### Tomcat

Please see https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-helloworld-application for tutorial on how to launch a WAR project in Tomcat in Intellij.
Then:

* Open this whole project in Intellij IDEA Ultimate, simply by File / Open... and clicking [build.gradle](build.gradle).
* Navigate to the `example-v8` project and launch it as an exploded WAR in Tomcat

## Testing

Please see the [Karibu-Testing](https://github.com/mvysny/karibu-testing) library, to learn more about how to test Karibu-DSL apps.
